<h2 class="chapter" id="chapter-3"><strong>Snow White</strong></h2>
<h2 class="chapter" id="chapter-4"><strong>and</strong></h2>
<h2 class="chapter" id="chapter-5"><strong>the Seven Dwarfs</strong></h2>
<h4 id="chapter-6"><strong>Part One</strong></h4>
<p>Once upon a time there was a little princess… She was called Snow White because she was white as snow. Her lips were red as blood. And her hair was black as night. She was a beautiful girl, sweet and gentle. She lived in a palace with her father and her stepmother: the King and the Queen. The Queen was a beautiful woman. But she was wicked and vain.</p>
<p>Every day, the Queen looked in her magic mirror and asked: “Mirror, mirror on the wall, Who’s the fairest of all?” And every day, the mirror answered: “You, my Queen! You are! You are the most beautiful of all.” Time passed and little Snow White became a beautiful young lady. Everybody loved her. One morning, when the Queen asked her magic mirror: “Mirror, mirror on the wall, Who’s the fairest of all?” The mirror answered: “My Queen, you are beautiful, it’s true! But Snow White is more beautiful than you.” The Queen was furious! She planned a horrible crime. She called a huntsman and commanded him: “Take Snow White deep into the forest… and kill her!” “But… Your Majesty! The beloved Princess!” he said. “Kill Snow White! And take out her heart,” the Queen commanded again.</p>
<h4 id="chapter-7"><strong>Part Two</strong></h4>
<p>The huntsman took Snow White deep into the woods. “Forgive me, my Princess… I have orders from the Queen to kill you! But I can’t do that!” he said. “Oh, good man!” she cried, “I’ll run into the forest and I’ll never come back!” Snow White ran and ran through the dark forest. She was so scared! Then, she found a little house. The door was open. She went in.</p>
<p>A little table was set for dinner: seven little chairs, seven little bowls, seven little spoons, seven little knives, seven little forks, and seven little mugs. Snow White was hungry and thirsty. She thought: “I’ll have a little bread from each bowl. And I’ll drink a little wine from each mug.” Then, feeling so tired, she lay down on one of the seven little beds. And she fell asleep. In the morning, she woke up and saw the seven masters of the house looking at her. They were seven dwarfs. “Who are you?” they asked. “My name is Snow White,” she answered. And she told them the whole story about the wicked Queen. “Princess Snow White, you can stay,” the Dwarfs said. “Can you help us cook and clean?” “Yes! I can cook and I can wash. And I can make beds,” she said happily. “Please, remember: don’t open the door to strangers!” said the Dwarfs. “The Queen will find you.”</p>
<h4 id="chapter-8"><strong>Part Three</strong></h4>
<p>At the Palace, the Queen asked her magic mirror: “Mirror, mirror on the wall, Who’s the fairest of all?” The mirror answered: “My Queen, you are beautiful, it’s true! But Snow White is more beautiful than you. In the mountains, she dwells And she is still alive and well.” The Queen was absolutely furious! “I will kill Snow White myself!” she thought. She made a deadly poison. Then, she put the poison in a beautiful red apple. The Queen, dressed in old clothes, went to the little house in the mountains. She knocked on the door, calling: “APPLES! JUICY APPLES! APPLES FOR SALE!” Snow White answered: “I’m sorry, madam. I can’t open the door to strangers.” “Oh, I’m just an old woman! Open the window and take one apple,” said the Queen. Snow White opened the window, took the apple and had one bite. She fell dead to the floor! “Now, I’m the most beautiful of all. Ha, ha, ha!” the Queen said and she ran away. Back at the Palace, the Queen ran to her magic mirror: “Mirror, mirror on the wall, Who’s the fairest of all?” The mirror answered: “You, my Queen! You are! You are the most beautiful of all.” The wicked Queen was happy now because the magic mirror never lied.</p>
<h4 id="chapter-9"><strong>Part Four</strong></h4>
<p>The Seven Dwarfs found Snow White dead on the floor. In her honor, they made her a glass coffin and placed it on top of a mountain. One day, a young Prince stopped to see her. And he fell in love with Snow White. With a kiss, she came back to a new life with her Prince. Snow White and the Prince had a big wedding. Everyone was invited to the celebration. Even the wicked Queen! And that night, when the Queen saw Snow White, she choked with envy and hate. And she fell dead to the floor. The Prince and the Princess lived happily ever after…</p>

<h4 id="chapter-10"><strong>What’s a Folktale?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>About the Stories in this Book</strong></p>
<p>You have read two popular folktales in English: Little Red Riding Hood and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Folktales is the name for very popular stories of oral tradition around the world. These stories pass down from one generation to the next generation: from parents to children and from grandparents to grandchildren. And from teachers to students! Folktales have a long life in popular culture. Their origins and authors are now lost. It is possible that there was not one origin or one author. Probably, folktales had several origins and several authors across time and across cultures. This means multiple contributors in time and space. So, variations in the stories are inevitable. famous stories in the world. They have been told and read millions of times in different languages: French, English, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, and the list goes on and on. We can find variations in the stories: the elements in the basket, the tricks of the wolf, the tricks of the wicked Queen and the endings! Folktales are fun for children and adults. They have been a common voice over the centuries: Aladdin, Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, Hansel and Gretel, Stone Soup, The Gingerbread Man… and so many more! Pick one… and keep reading! In stories for children, the forest is a symbol of danger and adventure. Little Red Riding Hood goes into the forest, Hansel and Gretel go into the forest, Snow White goes into the forest, too. And in the forest, they meet the Big Bad Wolf, the cruel Witch or the Seven Dwarfs. What is so fascinating about them? One possible answer is that forests are full of magic, mystery and horror. In books, the residents of the woods are monsters, dragons, bears, trolls, giants and more! Children -and adultslove to read scary stories. In the past, real forests were a real danger for children: there were bandits and wild animals. Adults told stories to children to teach them a lesson: Don’t go into the forest alone! Or the wolf will eat you up! Just like Little Red Riding Hood in one of the traditional endings written by Charles Perrault in 1697. In classic tales, forests are a mystery. Deep into the wood, anything is possible: talking animals, candy houses, and friendly dwarfs. There is no limit to fantasy and horror. And, maybe, this is the reason why we love these classics so much. They are an open door into the enchanted forest. We read the classics to enter the woods again and again and again.</p>
