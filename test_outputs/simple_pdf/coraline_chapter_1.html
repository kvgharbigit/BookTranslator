    <h2>IV. THE HOUSE LOOKED EXACTLY the same</h2>
    <p>IV. THE HOUSE LOOKED EXACTLY the same from the outside. Or almost exactly the same: around… V. CORALINE LOCKED THE DOOR of the drawing room with the cold black key. VI. CORALINE WAS WOKEN by the midmorning sun, full on her face. VII. SOMEWHERE INSIDE HER Coraline could feel a huge sob welling up. VIII. THE OTHER MOTHER looked healthier than before: there was a little blush to her cheeks… IX. OUTSIDE, THE WORLD HAD become a formless, swirling mist with no shapes or shadows… X. CORALINE WALKED UP THE stairs outside the building to the topmost flat</p>
