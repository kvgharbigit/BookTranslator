    <p>, Signal to Noise). He did the covers for the Sandman comics and books (collected in a book called Dustcovers).We’ve done a children’s picture book (The Day I Swapped My Dad for 2 Goldfish), which proved so popular in certain quarters that Dave redid the book cover as a CD cover, and it was on the side of buses all over the world.We have another picture book, called The Wolves in the Walls, which will come out when Dave finishes the drawings. This is why Dave McKean has illustrated Coraline. When I finished Coraline I needed some guinea pigs to read it. Dave has a daughter named Yolanda.

So the invitation to Yolanda’s birthday party was the picture of the Mouse Circus that finishes this book. When Dave e-mailed that drawing to me, I knew that I wanted him to do the rest of the pictures. Which, to my great delight, he did.And the pictures are very creepy, and very odd and very true. He even went to the house I used to live in, in Nutley, Sussex, and drew it. I like working with Dave, and hope he keeps drawing things I write forever.</p>
