    <h2>International Acclaim for Paulo Coelho’s</h2>
    <p>International Acclaim for Paulo Coelho’s THE ALCHEMIST “The story has the comic charm, dramatic tension, and psychological intensity of a fairy tale, but it’s full of specific wisdom as well. . . . A sweetly exotic tale for young and old alike.” —Publishers Weekly “Beneath this novel’s compelling story and the shimmering elegance with which it’s told lies a bedrock of wisdom about following one’s heart.” —Booklist “As memorable and meaningful as Saint-Exupéry’s The Little Prince.” —Austin American-Statesman “A touching, inspiring fable.” —Indianapolis Star “A little poke in the ribs from on high.” —Detroit Free Press “The Alchemist is a fabulous success.” —Der Spiegel (Germany)</p>
    <p>“A remarkable tale about the most magical of all journeys: the quest to fulfill one’s destiny. I recommend The Alchemist to anyone who is passionately committed to claiming the life of their dreams—today.” —Anthony Robbins, author of Awaken the Giant Within “An entrepreneurial tale of universal wisdom we can apply to the business of our own lives.” —Spencer Johnson, M.D., author of Who Moved My Cheese “An adventure story full of magic and wisdom.” —Rudolfo Anaya, author of Bless Me, Ultima “The Alchemist is a beautiful book about magic, dreams, and the treasures we seek elsewhere and then find at our doorstep.” —Madonna in Sonntag Aktuell (Germany) “The Alchemist is an unabashed delight and inspirational wonder. This fable is a roseate amalgam of spiritual quest, existential puzzle, lovely sensitivity, and deep strength.” —Malcolm Boyd, author of Are You Running with Me, Jesus? “Paulo Coelho knows the secret of literary alchemy.” —Kenzaburo Oé, winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature “A most tender and gentle story. It is a rare gem of a book, and will most certainly touch the very core of every heart earnestly seeking its own destiny on the journey of life.” —Gerald G. Jampolsky, M.D., coauthor of Change Your Mind, Change Your Life and Love Is Letting Go of Fear “Rarely do I come across a story with the directness and simplicity of Coelho’s The Alchemist. It lifts the reader out of time and focuses</p>
    <p>through a believably unlikely story on a young dreamer looking for himself. A beautiful story with a pointed message for every reader.” —Joseph Girzone, author of Joshua “This is the type of book that makes you understand more about yourself and about life. It has philosophy and is spiced with colors, flavors, and subjects, like a fairy tale. A lovely book.” —Yedi’ot Aharonot (Israel) “A boy named Santiago joins the ranks of Candide and Pinocchio by taking us on a very excellent adventure.” —Paul Zindel, author of the Pulitzer Prize–winning play The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds “The mystic quality in the odd adventures of the boy, Santiago, may bring not only him but others who read this fine book closer to recognizing and reaching their own inner destinies.” —Charlotte Zolotow, author of If You Listen “Paulo Coelho gives you the inspiration to follow your own dreams by seeing the world through your own eyes and not someone else’s.” —Lynn Andrews, author of the Medicine Woman series “Nothing is impossible, such is Coelho’s message, as long as you wish it with all your heart. No other book bears so much hope; small wonder its author became a guru among all those in search of the meaning of life.” —Focus (Germany) “The Alchemist is a truly poetic book.” —Welt am Sonntag (Germany)</p>
    <p>“Dotted throughout the story and illuminated in a poetic style are metaphors and deep insights that stir our imagination and transport the reader on a fantastic journey of the soul.” —Yomiuri Shimbun (Japan) “The Alchemist brings to mind The Little Prince by Saint-Exupéry and The Prophet by Khalil Gibran, as well as biblical parables.” —Gazeta Wyborcza (Poland) “The Alchemist is a beautiful and heartwarming story with an exotic flavor. . . . You may or may not agree with Paulo Coelho’s philosophy, but it’s nonetheless a tale that comforts our hearts as much as our souls.” —Bergensavisen (Norway) “The Alchemist is like a modern-day The Little Prince. A supreme and simple book.” —Milorad Pavic, author of Dictionary of the Khazars “Among Latin American writers, only Colombia’s Gabriel Garcia Marquez is more widely read than Brazil’s Paulo Coelho.” —The Economist</p>
