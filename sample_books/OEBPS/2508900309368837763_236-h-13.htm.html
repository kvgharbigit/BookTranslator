Shiv and the Grasshopper</h2>
<p class="center">
(The song that Toomai’s mother sang to the baby)
</p>
<p class="poem">
Shiv, who poured the harvest and made the winds to blow,<br/>
Sitting at the doorways of a day of long ago,<br/>
Gave to each his portion, food and toil and fate,<br/>
From the King upon the <i>guddee</i> to the Beggar at the gate.<br/>
    <i>All things made he—Shiva the Preserver.<br/>
    Mahadeo!  Mahadeo!  He made all,—<br/>
    Thorn for the camel, fodder for the kine,<br/>
    And mother’s heart for sleepy head, O little son of mine!</i><br/>
<br/>
Wheat he gave to rich folk, millet to the poor,<br/>
Broken scraps for holy men that beg from door to door;<br/>
Battle to the tiger, carrion to the kite,<br/>
And rags and bones to wicked wolves without the wall at night.<br/>
Naught he found too lofty, none he saw too low—<br/>
Parbati beside him watched them come and go;<br/>
Thought to cheat her husband, turning Shiv to jest—<br/>
Stole the little grasshopper and hid it in her breast.<br/>
    <i>So she tricked him, Shiva the Preserver.<br/>
    Mahadeo!  Mahadeo!  Turn and see.<br/>
    Tall are the camels, heavy are the kine,<br/>
    But this was Least of Little Things, O little son of mine!</i><br/>
<br/>
When the dole was ended, laughingly she said,<br/>
“Master, of a million mouths, is not one unfed?”<br/>
Laughing, Shiv made answer, “All have had their part,<br/>
Even he, the little one, hidden ’neath thy heart.”<br/>
From her breast she plucked it, Parbati the thief,<br/>
Saw the Least of Little Things gnawed a new-grown leaf!<br/>
Saw and feared and wondered, making prayer to Shiv,<br/>
Who hath surely given meat to all that live.<br/>
    <i>All things made he—Shiva the Preserver.<br/>
    Mahadeo!  Mahadeo!  He made all,—<br/>
    Thorn for the camel, fodder for the kine,<br/>
    And mother’s heart for sleepy head, O little son of mine!</i>
