ELEPHANTS OF THE GUN TEAMS
</p>
<p class="poem">
We lent to Alexander the strength of Hercules,<br/>
The wisdom of our foreheads, the cunning of our knees;<br/>
We bowed our necks to service: they ne’er were loosed again,—<br/>
Make way there—way for the ten-foot teams<br/>
    Of the Forty-Pounder train!
</p>
<p class="center">
GUN BULLOCKS
</p>
<p class="poem">
Those heroes in their harnesses avoid a cannon-ball,<br/>
And what they know of powder upsets them one and all;<br/>
Then we come into action and tug the guns again—<br/>
Make way there—way for the twenty yoke<br/>
    Of the Forty-Pounder train!

CAVALRY HORSES
</p>
<p class="poem">
By the brand on my shoulder, the finest of tunes<br/>
Is played by the Lancers, Hussars, and Dragoons,<br/>
And it’s sweeter than “Stables” or “Water” to me—<br/>
The Cavalry Canter of “Bonnie Dundee”!<br/>
<br/>
Then feed us and break us and handle and groom,<br/>
And give us good riders and plenty of room,<br/>
And launch us in column of squadron and see<br/>
The way of the war-horse to “Bonnie Dundee”!
</p>

SCREW-GUN MULES
</p>
<p class="poem">
As me and my companions were scrambling up a hill,<br/>
The path was lost in rolling stones, but we went forward still;<br/>
For we can wriggle and climb, my lads, and turn up everywhere,<br/>
Oh, it’s our delight on a mountain height, with a leg or two to spare!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to every sergeant, then, that lets us pick our road;<br/>
Bad luck to all the driver-men that cannot pack a load:<br/>
For we can wriggle and climb, my lads, and turn up everywhere,<br/>
Oh, it’s our delight on a mountain height, with a leg or two to spare!

COMMISSARIAT CAMELS
</p>
<p class="poem">
We haven’t a camelty tune of our own<br/>
To help us trollop along,<br/>
But every neck is a hair trombone<br/>
(<i>Rtt-ta-ta-ta!</i> is a hair trombone!)<br/>
And this our marching-song:<br/>
<i>Can’t!  Don’t!  Sha’n’t!  Won’t!</i><br/>
Pass it along the line!<br/>
Somebody’s pack has slid from his back,<br/>
Wish it were only mine!<br/>
Somebody’s load has tipped off in the road—<br/>
Cheer for a halt and a row!<br/>
<i>Urrr!  Yarrh!  Grr!  Arrh!</i><br/>
Somebody’s catching it now!

ALL THE BEASTS TOGETHER
</p>
<p class="poem">
Children of the Camp are we,<br/>
Serving each in his degree;<br/>
Children of the yoke and goad,<br/>
Pack and harness, pad and load.<br/>
See our line across the plain,<br/>
Like a heel-rope bent again,<br/>
Reaching, writhing, rolling far,<br/>
Sweeping all away to war!<br/>
While the men that walk beside,<br/>
Dusty, silent, heavy-eyed,<br/>
Cannot tell why we or they<br/>
March and suffer day by day.<br/>
    <i>Children of the Camp are we,<br/>
    Serving each in his degree;<br/>
    Children of the yoke and goad,<br/>
    Pack and harness, pad and load!</i>
